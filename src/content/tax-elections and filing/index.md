## Adulting Through Tribal Knowledge Is Probably Not So Good!
---

We are taught a lot of good stuff in our schooling throughout our childhood. Some of that knowledge has unfortunately become obselete with the advent of technology in the 21st century. Some classic examples, I believe, that no longer hold importance they used to are writing a letter to a bank manager to open a new account, filling in a demand draft, writing in cursive letters and so on. While this needs to be fixed, there is something else that needs to be added to our school curriculum on an extremely high priority basis, in detail. **Personal Finance** is the white elephant I am talking about and **Income Taxes, Filing and Returns** is the sub-topic I will focus on in this article. 

Every year, our workforce is increasing in leaps and bounds like our population. Our governments function on taxes we pay on our income. However, it has never been an income tax filing and returns has historically been a nightmare to most people because we are not made aware of this process from childhood and so we never got an opportunity to learn what it is like. We stumble upon this right after we find our first income generating working opportunity. The following year, we frantically try to gather some knowledge of taxes and around the filing season get the job done with since our lives are ever busy. And whom do we learn this **some knowledge** from? Mostly from our peers at work, friends, or family who probably themselves learned from similar circles. This unofficial spread of knowledge and its practical implementation in life is what I term as Tribal Knowledge. It works but is not guaranteed to work always. When Tribal Knowlege doesn't work, we are on our own, stuck or make mistakes. As adults, using tribal knowledge for an important task like **Filing Income Taxes, Filing and Returns** is not acceptable, given that there are serious repercussions in the form of wasted time and efforts, financial losses, monetary fines and jail terms for making mistakes in taxes.

## It is Tax Season!
---
Right after new year every year, the dreaded tax filing season starts. I call it dreaded because it has consistently been a nightmare to file income taxes and understand returns [sometimes deficits]. Despite efforts ranging from some to sincere ones, for many years I couldn't get a hold of

  1. How taxes are calculated by IRS [Internal Revenue Service]?
  2. How taxes are witheld by Employers
  3. How refunds are calculated and validated by tax filing systems/companies like Turbotax, H&R Block and many others.

This is mainly because of a combination of approaching Taxes through Tribal Knowledge and a lack of clear path to gain formal Tax education. But this year, I have put in considerable amount of efforts to understand my tax situation and hence wanted to blog it for others who are in the same boat like me, with a need and interest to learn taxes at length for good.

Tax is a big problem to answer in one single article. Hence I decided to log my learnings and findings for one subsect of taxpayers, i.e employees on fixed wages. This subsect itself can be further broken down to employees having one or more of these below situations:

Employees with Fixed Wages:
    1. Receiving single or multiple pay checks a month
    2. Eligible for Stock Options / Restricted Stock Units
    3. Eligible for Commuter Benefits
    4. Eligibile for 401K or Retirement Account Matching by employer
    5. Eligble for Health Care [HSA or FSA] contributions

## The Situation
---
For better understanding of the math involved in the rest of this article, let us assume a fictional person named John Adams born on 1st February, 1995 took up his first ever job with a fictional company named ABC Systems on 1st December, 2020, while still pursuing his graduate studies at XYZ University. John's compensation details are as below:

1. John gets paid an annual salary of USD 180,000 and gets paid twice a month.
2. John is granted 1000 RSUs where the shares vest 25% each year as long as he is employed on the date of vesting. i.e John gets his first 250 shares on 1st December 2021. 2nd batch on 1st December 2022, 3rd batch on 1st December 2023 and the last batch on 1st December 2022. The per share price of ABC Systems on 1st December 2020 is USD 100.
3. John is eligible for 3 weeks of Paid Time Off every year and the vacation gets accrued if not used up until a maximum of 200 hours. At the time of employment termination, any accrued vacation will be paid his then prevailing hourly rate.
4. John is eligible for upto 15% performance based bonus per year
5. ABC Systems matches John's 401K Contributions upto 6% of his pay check
6. John can select a health insurance plan from 4 options for a subsidized rate
7. ABC Systems offers a Health Savings Account contribution of upto USD 3000 if John selects a High Deducticle High Pay [HDHP] insurance plan and also contributes to his HSA 
8. ABC Systems offers a pre-tax Commuter Benefits upto USD 300 a month
9. ABC Systems re-imburses on education expenses like tuition fees, books etc... upto USD 20,000 when pursuing studies in field relevant to ABC Systems interest.

On 1st Feb 2021 John gets an email from the HR saying his W2 form is available tax year 2020. John, over lunch talk learns that Income Taxes need to be filed by 1st April 2021. Since this is is first time filing taxes, John decided to hire the services of a Tax preparation officer for USD 500 and got his taxes done. He even got a refund of USD 120. 

John, being a young and dynamic employee in great health, worked real hard in the year 2021 year and took no vacation. He also aced his annual performance review and received a 15% bonus. He was also granted the 250 RSU shares on 1st Dec, 2021.

On 1st Feb 2022, John received another email from HR saying W2 form is available for tax year 2021. John pays attention to his W2 this time and is perplexed with the big numbers on it. So this time, he decided to learn **Income Tax Filing and Returns** in details. We have access to John's 2021 W2 form. Let us help him with our knowledge.

### John's Benefits Elections
---
1. John wants all his salary to be deposited to his **checkings account** in the **Best Finance Bank**
2. John setup his account with the ABC Systems suggested Brokerage Firm to manage his RSUs and elected these options:

    a. Sell immediately on vest date to pay taxes.

    b. Transfer any remaining money post sale to his checkings account in Best Finance Bank.

3. John elected the health insurance plan that costs his USD 300 per pay check
4. John setup a HSA account and set his contributions to USD 3000
5. John set his 401K Contribution to 6%
6. John sometimes drives to work and sometimes uses public transit. So he setup a commuter benefit card to pay for parking and public transit at USD 300. Commute actually costs John a monthly average of USD 450.
7. John used the education reimbursement option to pay his school fee of USD 27000 per year.

### Understanding the Pay Check
---

John receives two pay checks per month. Each pay check must have the following information at the least.


### Learn The Terminology
---
